use setClipRectangle on the intersection area in each _render() method
(remember to unsetClipRectangle at the end of _render)


if openStream fails - need to make sure either:
contents picture gets filled with black, or
VideoClass_render does not make a transparent rectangle in the overlay picture


in all VisibleClass objects
only redraw them in SetPosition/SetBoxSize/etc if they actually move/change size/etc


print avstream error message in rb-browser if openStream fails


use -t timeout when searching for initial object to boot


handle SIGPIPE - default handler terminates the process


are all inherited instance vars added to classes?


use a timer to poll for missing content once/second?


do the remaining Clone methods


make sure caller_gid doesnt get passed on too far from ElementaryAction_execute
(eg TokenGroupClass_CallActionSlot)


cope with DSM: and CI: filename prefixes
cope with .. in filenames (may not be needed, remote backend does it for us,
for local backend filesystem does it for us)
see 8.3.2 in UK MHEG Profile


have a monitor/debugger console


change fatal()'s to error()'s where possible


change all LIST macros to take TYPE as first param
