posix_fadvise() when streaming data from the backend?


aspect ratio


if video size != VideoClass size, draw a smaller transparent hole
or fill the frame edges with black
also fill with black after SetVideoDecodeOffset


use ffmpeg to permenantly scale-up bitmaps in MHEGBitmap_fromRGBA
(rather than having to apply an XRender xform matrix and filter each time)


vsync video drawing with monitor refresh


better audio sync in MHEGStreamPlayer


in all VisibleClass objects
only redraw them in SetPosition/SetBoxSize/etc if they actually move/change size/etc


print avstream error message in rb-browser if openStream fails


only use -t timeout when searching for boot obj?
all other times raise ContentRefError immediately?


handle SIGPIPE - default handler terminates the process


are all inherited instance vars added to classes?


use a timer to poll for missing content once/second?


do the remaining Clone methods


make sure caller_gid doesnt get passed on too far from ElementaryAction_execute
(eg TokenGroupClass_CallActionSlot)


cope with CI: filename prefixes
see 8.3.2 in UK MHEG Profile


have a monitor/debugger console


change fatal()'s to error()'s where possible


change all LIST macros to take TYPE as first param
