NewContentSize param in NewReferencedContent should compile to:
[CONTEXT 234] { ... [UNIVERSAL 5] ... }
not just [CONTEXT 234] { ... nothing ... }
- ie need to add an explicit Null child node

same with ConnectionTag param in TransitionTo

temp fix - add "Null" to the relevent 2 places in the grammar?
real fix - add "Identifier?" to the grammar => optional, but adds a Null if not
           present (or perhaps "<Identifier>")

---

output filename should default to App/Scene GroupIdentifier rather than "a"
(but warn if file exists - stops accidental overwrite of source!)

convert_BASE64() function

change fatal()'s to parse_error()'s in convert_STRING() et al.
