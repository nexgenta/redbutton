replace TRUE/FALSE with stdbool

work out why this happened on BBC1 once:
read: Value too large for defined data type
Unable to read PID

have a verbose flag

use a linked list of modules rather than an array in struct carousel
=> easier to delete/add modules

transactionId in DII messages is a version number
=> need to download again if it gets bigger
(we currently just look at the module version, is this enough?)

what happens when you change channel?
(kill -9 and restart with the new programme_number?)

create carousels/PID/CID dir in add_dsmcc_pid()
(may need to use carousels/<assoc_tag> as stream2pid may return 0)
