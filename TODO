be able to read from a file

have a verbose flag

use a linked list of modules rather than an array in struct carousel
=> easier to delete/add modules

transactionId in DII messages is a version number
=> need to download again if it gets bigger
(we currently just look at the module version, is this enough?)

create carousels/PID/CID dir in add_dsmcc_pid()
(may need to use carousels/<assoc_tag> as stream2pid may return 0)
